      question: 'What is CDM and how is it converted into KGS?',
      answer: 'CDM means Cubic Decimeter. For Andhra Pradesh, 2CDM = 1Kg. Articles which are light in weight and occupy more space are charged on CDM basis. Multiplication of Length, Width and Height (LxWxH of a consignment) divided by 2 gives the consignment\'s weight. For Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Pondicherry, the CDM should be divided by 2.5 to get the weight in Kgs.'
